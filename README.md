# 👻 WayVNC Ghost Monitor for Hyprland

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is **not an official WayVNC package**.  
> It’s a community-created script for integrating WayVNC with Hyprland using a headless (ghost) monitor setup.

Create a **ghost monitor** (a virtual headless output) in [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) and stream it wirelessly using [WayVNC](https://github.com/any1/wayvnc).

👻 **Seamlessly turn any laptop or PC** with a VNC viewer (like TigerVNC) into a **wireless display** for your Hyprland setup — with **automatic cleanup** when you're done!

---

## ✨ Features

- Dynamically creates a **virtual headless monitor**
- Assigns a workspace to the ghost monitor
- Automatically **cleans up** on exit (moves workspace back and stops WayVNC)
- Keeps your **real monitor focused**
- Works with **any VNC viewer** like TigerVNC or RealVNC

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) (version 0.48.0 or later)
- [WayVNC](https://github.com/any1/wayvnc) (version 0.9.1 or later)
- A POSIX-compatible shell like `bash` or `zsh`  
  > 📝 This script is written in `zsh`, but it works in `bash` too — just update the (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`) if needed.

### 📦 WayVNC Dependencies

Ensure the following packages are installed (package names may vary by distribution):

- `wayland`
- `pixman`
- `glibc`
- `jansson`
- `libxkbcommon`
- `libdrm`
- `libxcb`
- `xcb-util`
- `neatvnc`
- `aml`
- `pam` (optional, for authentication)

You can install them using your distro's package manager (e.g., `pacman`, `apt`, `dnf`) or build from source as outlined in the [WayVNC GitHub repo](https://github.com/any1/wayvnc#dependencies).

---

### 🖥️ Platform Compatibility

This script is designed **specifically for Linux systems running Hyprland on Wayland** to allow them to connect to **any system that can run a compatible VNC viewer**. It will **not work on**:

- macOS or Windows
- X11-based desktop environments
- Other compositors like GNOME, KDE Plasma, or Sway

It relies on `hyprctl`, which is exclusive to Hyprland, and WayVNC, which only runs on Wayland.

---

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wayvnc-hyprland-ghost-monitor.git
   cd wayvnc-hyprland-ghost-monitor
   ```

2. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x wayvnc-ghost-monitor.sh
   ```

3. **Configure the script as needed:**
   Edit the following variables at the top of the script to match your setup:
   ```sh
   VIRTUAL_MONITOR="HEADLESS-2"   # Name of the ghost monitor
   VIRTUAL_WORKSPACE=3            # Workspace to assign to the ghost monitor
   REAL_MONITOR="DP-2"            # Your real physical monitor
   ```

   > ⚠️ **NOTE:** If you already use 3 or more workspaces or monitors by default, consider setting `VIRTUAL_WORKSPACE` to a higher number (e.g., 10 or 11) to avoid conflicts or unexpected behavior.

4. **Hyprland Configuration (if needed):**

   If you're using a **static monitor setup**, you'll need to manually define the ghost monitor:

   - **Regular Hyprland:** Add the following line to the `monitors` section of `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`
   - **HyDE Hyprland:** Add the line to `~/.config/hypr/monitors.conf`

   ```ini
   monitor=HEADLESS-2,1920x1080@60,0x0,1
   ```

   > ⚠️ **NOTE:** While this script attempts to dynamically create a headless monitor using `hyprctl output create`, **some setups (especially with HyDE Hyprland or stricter monitor management)** may still require the monitor to be declared manually for consistent behavior.
   >
   > We **intentionally omitted automatic config file editing** from the script to prevent potential issues with your Hyprland setup. It's safer to manually add the entry and back up your configuration beforehand.

   If you're using dynamic monitor creation in regular Hyprland and don’t have a static layout, this step may not be necessary.

   For GUI-based monitor management, consider using [ngx-displays](https://github.com/Aylur/ngx-displays).

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   ./wayvnc-ghost-monitor.sh
   ```

2. **Connect from another device using a VNC viewer:**
   ```bash
   vncviewer your-hyprland-ip:5900
   ```

   > 💡 You can use any VNC viewer like [TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/) or [RealVNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/).

---

## 🧼 Cleanup on Exit

When you press `Ctrl+C` or the script ends:
- WayVNC is stopped
- The workspace is moved back to your real monitor
- Monitor focus is restored

No manual cleanup required!

---

## 🖱️ Add as a Launchable Desktop App (with Icon)

You can make this script behave like a regular application with a desktop icon and launcher menu entry:

### 1. Create a `.desktop` file

Create a file named `wayvnc-ghost-monitor.desktop` in either:

- `~/.local/share/applications/` (user only), or  
- `/usr/share/applications/` (system-wide — requires root)

Example contents:
```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Name=WayVNC Ghost Monitor
Comment=Launch WayVNC on a virtual headless monitor (Hyprland only)
Exec=/absolute/path/to/wayvnc-ghost-monitor.sh
Icon=/absolute/path/to/ghost.png
Terminal=true
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;Network;
```

> 💡 Replace `/absolute/path/to/...` with the full paths to your script and icon.

---

### 2. Use the Ghost Icon

You can use the included ghost icon (`ghost.png`) as the application icon.  
Recommended location:
```bash
~/.local/share/icons/ghost.png
```

---

### 3. Make the Script Executable

Ensure your script has the right permissions:
```bash
chmod +x /absolute/path/to/wayvnc-ghost-monitor.sh
```

---

### 4. (Optional) Update Application Menu

If it doesn’t show up in your launcher right away:
```bash
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
```

---

### 5. Launch It Like Any App!

Now you can find **WayVNC Ghost Monitor** in your app launcher or application menu just like any other program
